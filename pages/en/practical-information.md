# Scout farm Tydal
Tydal Jamborette 2024 will take place at Spejderg√•rden Tydal, a protected natural area down towards the Trene river, which in summer offers good bathing opportunities. Tydal's area covers a total of 74 ha of land with ball fields, forest and camp sites.
The nearest towns are Eggebek (2 km) and Tarp (4 km). Spejderg√•rden Tydal is centrally located and suitable as a starting point for bus trips to the region's many historic sites.
Find more information at tydal.dk.
# Transport to Tydal
Tydal Jamborette 2024 is all about sustainability. Therefore, the camp will encourage you to arrange shared transport to the camp. The camp management can help with contact between the groups.
## Train
The nearest railway station is in Tarp. From here it is a short walk of 5 km to the Jamborette. Tickets can be ordered via DSB (to Flensburg) and DB (Flensburg to Tarp).
## Bus
Buses can stop close to the campsite. If there are not enough of you to fill a bus, you can contact one of the other participating groups and arrange shared transport.
## Bike
The jamborette can also be reached via good cycle routes from DK. From Denmark you have to hit H√¶rvejsruten no. 3 or √òsters√∏ruten no. 8 - get an overview of all national cycle routes at ruter.dk. From Flensburg you follow the route "Ochsenweg" to Oeversee, here you turn towards Tarp and Spejderg√•rden Tydal. As a real stage race in the Tour de France, a yellow, green or dotted leader's jersey is offered to everyone who has taken the bike to the Jamborette. Remember the bike helmet! üö¥
## Trailer
It is possible to push a trailer to your own campsite. It is not permitted to drive a car on the campsite area. As a rule, trailers must not be left on the campsite during the camp.
## Sanitary conditions
There are toilets and showers with hot water in the campsite area. The participants take turns cleaning the facilities.
## Wastesorting
At Tydal, we sort waste according to the applicable regulations in the area, i.e. according to German sorting standards.
You can read more about waste sorting at Tydal Jamborette 2024 at [jamborette.de/en/waste/](/en/waste/).
Please note that waste can only be handed in at certain times during the camp.

# Program
You can find more information at [jamborette.de/en/programme](/en/programme/).
## Flag raising and ironing
There will be a joint flag raising at 9:00 on the parade ground. Which group is responsible for flag raising and ironing will be delegated on the day of the leaders' meeting. The flag must always be taken down before sunset, but no later than 20:00
## Future festival
Thursday 25 July is earmarked for the future festival. You can read more here: [jamborette.de/en/future-festival/](/en/future-festival/).
## Visiting day
Thursday 25 July there is an open house at Tydal Jamborett 2024. Here you can invite your parents and friends to an unforgettable day from 1.30pm - 5.00pm.

## Cold room for medicine or special needs
There will be the option of a cold room for special needs. For example, storage of medicine, or people who bring their own food due to allergies etc.
Contact forplejning@jamborette.de to reserve a place in the cold room.
## Kitchenware packing list
In addition to the usual scout cookware, you need a potato masher, a grater and a can opener.
To avoid using tinfoil or cling film, you can bring beeswax food paper/beeswax wraps (30cm x 30cm). It could be advantageously done as before a task at a scout meeting.
## Starter package
Each group is given a starter box with common spices and waste bags, as well as a cookbook.

# The group's campsite
## Campfires
As a starting point, the existing campfires on the assigned campsite must be used. A new one may only be dug if there is no fire pit. Newly dug fire pits must be swept after the camp. Campfires must be left nicer than they are.
## Grease traps
Grease traps must not be dug on the campsite itself, but in a safe place in the vegetation. Food scraps must not be poured into the grease trap - only waste water.
## Firewood
A regular use of firewood is included. Firewood sheds can be found on the camp map.
## Rafters
There are rafters on Tydal. Each group has the opportunity to build a regular camp site. Rafteg√•rd can be found on the camp map.
## Plant box
All groups will be given some wooden planters planted with spices that can be used for cooking. The groups must subsequently take these planters home in the group.
Attached is a picture to suggest the installation of the planters, but you are free to be creative yourself. We suggest you choose pioneer rope or hay spinning twine/sisal for the installation.

*The cafe will be open most of the time, with the exception of certain events, where it will be closed for the rest of the camp.
**After 10 pm it will not be open for children and young people under 18 years of age.

## Smoking
Smoking is only permitted at campfires and in the courtyard.
## Alcohol
Bringing alcohol is not allowed at the camp. If you want to enjoy alcohol, you must be in the caf√© area on the market square, where it is possible to buy wine and beer after 22:00. The age limit for the bar is 18 years.
## Map of the camp
You can already click on the camp map to see an overview of Tydal Jamborette 2024. But remember that changes may occur at any time.

# Security
## Fire
If a fire occurs that you cannot put out yourself, call 112 and then contact the camp office immediately. Always remember to have a bucket filled with water by the campfire. Feel free to bring fire jackets.
## Oil line
An underground oil pipeline runs across the Tydal area. This is marked with red/white poles. No digging, lighting fires or setting up tents within a distance of 5 meters on both sides of the oil pipeline.
## Siren
In Germany, the voluntary fire service is alerted using sirens, which howl 3 times in the event of fire, accidents, etc. These sirens are tested every Saturday at 12.00 with a single howl. Should you hear the sound of a siren one of these days, don't panic, the siren is important to the volunteer fire brigade, not to us scouts.
