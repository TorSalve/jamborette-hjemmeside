We look forward to welcoming you and 800 children and young people to Tydal Jamborette 2024, the Dansk Spejderkorps Sydslesvigs most fantastic camp.
You will find all the information you need to pre-register your group on this page.
If you have any questions, please write to [info@jamborette.de](mailto:info@jamborette.de).

# How to register and your group
You register your group using the form: [Pre-registration](/en/registration/pre-registration).
Final registration opens around March 2024.
When the number of participants reaches approx. 800 units added later may be rejected.

Are you a volunteer? Read more about registration of volunteers [here](/en/registration/volunteer).

# What does the price include?
It costs €165 to join the camp from the 20th of July until the 27th of July.
Participants who wish to participate for fewer days pay €30 per night.
The price is determined such that there is money to cover the costs of activities, overnight charges and food.

When the pre-registration is closed, you will receive a reservation confirmation, which, among other things, contains a charge of a deposit of €50 per registered person.
The deposit will be deducted from the final price for your group.
In case of cancellation, the deposit is not refunded.
The final payment will be made shortly before the camp.

# Cubcamp
Tydal Jamborette 2024 offers cubs, minis and juniors (6-12 years old) to participate in a shortened camp.
The cubcamp takes place from the 24th of July until the 27th of July.
During this period, there will be activities and events designed especially for cubs, such as an opening campfire for cubs on the evening of the 24th of July.

Cubs, minis, and juniors can participate in the camp.
There will be activities suitable for the age group throughout the camp; however, the central part of events designed for the age group will take place in the second half of the camp.
Please indicate in the advance registration whether you expect your cubs, minis and juniors to participate in the whole camp or only parts.

Participation in the cubcamp will be settled according to the daily rate, i.e. participation from the 24th of July until the 27th of July costs €90.
