We look forward to welcoming you and 800 children and young people to Tydal Jamborette 2024, the Dansk Spejderkorps Sydslesvigs most fantastic camp.
You will find all the information you need to pre-register your group on this page.
If you have any questions, please write to [info@jamborette.de](mailto:info@jamborette.de).

# How to register and your group
Final registration is now open.
You register your group using the following form: [Registration](/en/registration/final-registration).

Are you a helper? Read more about registration for volunteers [here](/en/registration/volunteer).

# What does the price include?
It costs €165 to join from 20 July until 27 July.
Participants who wish to participate in fewer days pay €30 per night.
The price is determined after the camp has to run around, so that there is money to cover the costs of activities, equipment and catering.
Children under 4 years old do not pay.

A deposit of €50 per registered person has been charged for pre-registration.
The deposit will be deducted from the final price for your group.
In case of cancellation, the deposit is not refunded.
The final payment will be made shortly before the camp.

# Cubcamp
Tydal Jamborette 2024 offers cubs, minis and juniors (6-12 years old) to participate in a shortened camp.
The cubcamp takes place from the 24th of July until the 27th of July.
During this period, there will be activities and events designed especially for cubs, such as an opening campfire for cubs on the evening of the 24th of July.

Cubs, minis, and juniors can participate in the camp.
There will be activities suitable for the age group throughout the camp; however, the central part of events designed for the age group will take place in the second half of the camp.
Please indicate in the advance registration whether you expect your cubs, minis and juniors to participate in the whole camp or only parts.

Participation in the cubcamp will be settled according to the daily rate, i.e. participation from the 24th of July until the 27th of July costs €90.
