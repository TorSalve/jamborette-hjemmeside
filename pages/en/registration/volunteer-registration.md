We look forward to welcoming you and 800 youths to Tydal Jamborette 2024, the Dansk Spejderkorps Sydslesvigs most fantastic camp.
And we are delighted that you want to help create the camp!
If you have any questions, please write to [info@jamborette.de](mailto:info@jamborette.de).

We do our best to make it fun to be a helper at Jamborette 2024.
You become part of the larger community, making a big difference in the camp.
Therefore, there will be various events and initiatives leading up to and during the camp so that everyone feels part of the community and gets an experience of personal development.
These events can, for example, be courses before the camp or the various social events and activities aimed at helpers during the camp.
