We are so super happy to be able to introduce you to Tydal Jamborette 2024's camp song! ðŸ¤© We think it turned out super good. You can listen to the camp song already now and you are more than welcome to practice the song with us.
Most of the song is in Danish, but maybe that helps you sharpen your language skills ðŸ˜ƒ However, one verse is in English!
