# Here it is: Tydal Jamborette 2024's logo!
We have received input from some cool scouts from the Danish Scout Corps South Schleswig - thanks to all of you who participated in our logo competition. You have thrown a lot of good ideas our way, which have helped us well on our way to a finished logo.


The logo consists of four leaves that are shaped like a scout lily and are tied together by a rope, inspired by the camp's theme: 'We tie the knot'. [You can download the logo here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IlsbvD2opkYlAcCWNLWvnAxSgzOXl-xM?usp=sharing)
