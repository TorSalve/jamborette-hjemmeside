Would you like to be part of the team that makes Tydal Jamborette 2024 a fantastic experience for everyone? Right now we are looking for helpers to help plan and organize the camp. Five committees have already been made: Activities, camp life, catering, communication and administration.

# Become a volunteer

Would you like to be a helper at Jamborette 2024? Then you can already register now. [Read more here](/en/become-a-volunteer/) about how to volunteer.

# Registration

You can read more about how to register as a helper [here](/en/registration/volunteer).

# Life as a helper

## Where will we stay and eat?

You decide for yourself whether you want to live with your scout group, or whether you want to live in the helper camp with, for example, your clan or family. As a helper, you can get food in the helper's kitchen if you do not live with your group.

## Reduction in price for helpers

The volunteers who make a significant effort in planning, organizing and/or cleaning up the camp will get a reduction in the price and must therefore pay €110. The participation price is €165. It costs nothing to participate in Tydal Jamborette 2024's pre-camp and post-camp.

## Volunteers who do not live at the camp

The camp will benefit from a lot of zealots who want to help out at the camp, but who prefer to stay at home. Helpers at the camp who choose to live outside the camp and therefore do not live at the camp do not have to pay to participate. They have the option of taking a packed lunch with them.
