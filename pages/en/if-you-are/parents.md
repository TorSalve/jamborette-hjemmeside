Welcome to Tydal Jamborette 2024 – Danish Scout Association South Schleswig (DSS) corps camp, which brings together scouts of all ages from near and far! For the 14th time we are holding the international 'Tydal Jamborette' at Spejdergården Tydal, and this year the camp takes place from the 20th-27th. July 2024.

DSS is the only Danish scout corps outside of Denmark. We are a nice little group that lives south of the border in Germany and often speak with a slight accent. We are based at our beautiful Spejdergård Tydal, a huge natural area for scouting.

At Tydal Jamborette 2024 there is a unique opportunity for children and young people to explore nature, build lifelong friendships and develop practical skills. We want to inspire and challenge the scouts' imaginations, create lifelong memories and promote values such as community, sustainability and outdoor life. Therefore, there will be a lot of activities dealing with these topics.

At the camp, the scouts will, among other things, go on a hiking trip somewhere in South Schleswig, visit a Viking village, and quite the contrary be trained for the future. We are very much looking forward to welcoming all the scouts who come to visit.
