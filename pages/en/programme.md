# Activities
Meet the Midgard Serpent in our Viking town, move your body to cool music at our movement activity and compete against other groups in an interactive board game. The jamboree is jam-packed with exciting activities where there is room for all age groups. There will be a focus on community and the classic scouting spirit. The activities are framed through unique stories.

As stated in the programme, there will be four activity periods of 2.5 hours, two in the morning from 09:30-12:00 and two in the afternoon from 14:00-16:30. Scouts (junior, troop and senior) will alternately experience the three activity centers which take place on Wednesday and Friday. During the activity period on Sunday, we are in the process of planning a joint activity. No additional registration is required.

## The cubs between 6-10 years
We have put together a separate program for our scouts between 6-10 years of age. The cubs (the mini and micro scouts), who arrive during Wednesday morning, will experience how the Anglers lived in the Iron Age. This is the theme for both the activity period on Wednesday afternoon and Friday morning.

St. Georgsgilderne invites you to activities such as cooking, carving, felting and much more. In addition, we will hold Peter Pedal's birthday party on Friday.


## Hike
A classic hike with a twist. We won't reveal anything yet - but we promise it will be wild!

Patrol-wise registration is required and you must be at least 11 years old to participate in the hike. The hike is approx. 25 km long.

# Future Festival
Thursday is earmarked for a very special event - a FUTURE FESTIVAL. Together, we must give the camp's children and young people a set of skills to face the future. The themes: creativity, communication, sustainable food, problem solving and teamwork form the starting point for today's programme. Read more [here](/en/future-festival).

# Campfire
The campfire is the starting point and the end of the camp. Take your friends by the arm and participate in our joint start and finish of the Jamborette 2024! We must sing, laugh, shout and create the best atmosphere together.

## Opening campfire
The opening campfire is the kick-off to a fantastic Jamborette 2024! Come and join us when the scout band plays and we learn the camp song together. The opening campfire is a great opportunity to feel how many of us there are and get into a real camp mood. We present the camp management, the committees and the activities you can get involved in, sing all the best Scout songs and enjoy the warm summer evening.

## Closing campfire
After a wonderful and eventful week, it is now time to say goodbye. We will celebrate the great week we have experienced together with a common campfire, where everyone joins in and sings the camp song one last time - loudly in chorus! Together we will remember the week we have had and enjoy one last evening in the spirit of community.

All groups are asked to make a feature. So put your heads together and come up with your interpretations of well-known sketches, song plays or something else entirely. Limited only by imagination.
