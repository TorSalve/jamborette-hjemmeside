_Why do you think it's cool to be camp chief for Jamborette 2024?_\
Summer camp is usually the highlight of the year for most scouts. I am passionate about creating great experiences for children and young people. As camp chief, I would like to ensure that as many South Schleswig scouts as possible will get an experience that lasts of the rest of their life.

_What are you most looking forward to at Jamborette 2024?_\
I look forward to creating an unforgettable experience for scouts of all age groups. And I am very much looking forward to when we all meet for the first time at the opening campfire.

_What is your best camp experience?_\
My favorite camp experience has probably been when I was at a huge camp for the first time in 2009 at Blå sommer and found out how many Scouts we actually were. Otherwise, also our own training at Tydal, when I myself was a participant and for the first time had contact with other scouts from other groups (With whom I actually still have contact today)

_What is your favorite scouting activity?_\
I love summer camps, as you have the opportunity to be at camp several days in a row, and can unfold camp life much more than just on a single weekend. Then I also love being on scout runs, as I love challenges and the unexpected.

_Why do you think it's cool to be camp chief for Jamborette 2024?_\
The Jamboree has always been a highlight of my scouting life. It will be great to help create a fantastic camp that can be another highlight for all of us.

_What are you most looking forward to at Jamborette 2024?_\
I am looking forward to seeing all the scouts come to Tydal to have a great camp. And then I look forward to getting around to all the activities to say hello to all the scouts.

_What is your best camp experience?_\
My best experience was at Jamborette 2011, where we were allowed to grow our own vegetables at the camp.

_What is your favorite scouting activity?_\
  I love sitting by the campfire and talking with my scout friends. Otherwise, let's build something!
